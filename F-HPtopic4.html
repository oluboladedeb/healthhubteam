					<p><h3>Add Protein to Your Diet</h3>
						When it comes to weight loss, protein is the king of nutrients.

						Your body burns calories when digesting and metabolizing the protein you eat, so a high-protein diet can boost metabolism by up to 80–100 calories per day (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source)

						A high-protein diet can also make you feel more full and reduce your appetite. In fact, some studies show that people eat over 400 fewer calories per day on a high-protein diet (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).

						Even something as simple as eating a high-protein breakfast (like eggs) can have a powerful
					</p>

					<p><h3>Eat Whole, Single-Ingredient Foods</h3>
						One of the best things you can do to become healthier is to base your diet on whole, single-ingredient foods.

						By doing this, you eliminate the vast majority of added sugar, added fat and processed food.

						Most whole foods are naturally very filling, making it a lot easier to keep within healthy calorie limits (7Trusted Source).

						Furthermore, eating whole foods also provides your body with the many essential nutrients that it needs to function properly.

						Weight loss often follows as a natural side effect of eating whole foods.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h3>Avoid Processed Foods</h3>
						Processed foods are usually high in added sugars, added fats and calories.

						What’s more, processed foods are engineered to make you eat as much as possible. They are much more likely to cause addictive-like eating than unprocessed foods 
					</p>
					
					<p><h3>Limit Your Intake of Added Sugar</h3>
						Eating a lot of added sugar is linked with some of the world’s leading diseases, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source).

						On average, Americans eat about 15 teaspoons of added sugar each day. This amount is usually hidden in various processed foods, so you may be consuming a lot of sugar without even realizing it (15).

						Since sugar goes by many names in ingredient lists, it can be very difficult to figure out how much sugar a product actually contains.

						Minimizing your intake of added sugar is a great way to improve your diet.
					</p>


					<p><h3>Drink Water</h3>
						There is actually truth to the claim that drinking water can help with weight loss.

						Drinking 0.5 liters (17 oz) of water may increase the calories you burn by 24–30% for an hour afterward (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).

						Drinking water before meals may also lead to reduced calorie intake, especially for middle-aged and older people (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).

						Water is particularly good for weight loss when it replaces other beverages that are high in calories and sugar (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).
