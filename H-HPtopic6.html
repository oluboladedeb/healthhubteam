				<div class="body-text">
					<p>
						 <h3>Depression and stroke</h3>

						Strokes are caused when your brain loses its blood supply. This often happens because of a blood clot that is blocking the passage of blood through an artery.

						People who’ve had a stroke often report feeling symptoms of depression. Post-stroke depression is the most frequentTrusted Source psychiatric complication of stroke. Almost a third of those who’ve had a stroke develop depression. However, most of cases of depression after stroke aren’t diagnosed. Doctors may overlook checking for depression signs. People who have had a stroke can either hide the symptoms or not be aware of them. A caregiver can give great insight and help identify depression early.

						Depression can affect a person’s quality of life. It can also make it more difficult to recover from a stroke. Depression can also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, which in turn increases the risk of experiencing another stroke. Mortality rates are 10 times higher in people who experience depression after a stroke.

						Post-stroke depression can be managed with treatment. ResearchTrusted Source suggests that mental function is improved in people who are treated for depression.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h3>Risk factors for depression after a stroke</h3>
						You’re more likely to have depression after a stroke if you:

						had a previous mental illness are female
						had a previous condition that affected how you think, such as a traumatic brain injury
						had previous functional difficulties, such as those that may be caused by Parkinson’s disease or other neuromuscular disorders live alone
						Strokes that cause a high degree of physical disability and neurological problems also raise your risk. For example, if you develop aphasia after a stroke, you’re more likely to become depressed. Aphasia reduces your ability to talk and understand words.  
					</p>
					<p>
						<h3>Symptoms of post-stroke depression</h3>
							Every case of post-stroke depression can have different symptoms and duration. Most symptoms appear between three to six months after a stroke. However, the onset can be as early as a month and as late as several years after a stroke. This difference in onset times may be due to two factors — biochemical changes that occur in the brain following a stroke and changes in mood and personality that occur over time. The latter may result from:
							<ul>
								<li>social circumstances, such as loneliness, lack of social interaction</li>
								<li>genetics</li>
								<li>limitations in physical and mental abilities following the stroke</li>
								If you’re the caregiver of a person who has recently suffered a stroke, watch out for these nine symptoms:
							</ul>
							<ol>
								<li>continuous feelings of sadness and </li>
								<li>loss of interest in normally pleasurable activities</li>
								<li>feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness</li>
								<li>fatigue</li>
								<li>difficulty focusing and irritability</li>
								<li>disturbed sleep patterns, such as sleeping too much or too little</li>
								<li>loss of appetite or overeating</li>
								<li>reduced interest in spending time with friends and family</li>
								<li>suicidal thoughts</li>
